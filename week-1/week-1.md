# Week 1

This week was an introduction to the C programming language. Basic concepts and command line applications.

## Problem set 1

These problems were basic problems, but designed to write the first bits of code in the C programming language. Of course there is the classic hello world example. 

The second problem was to create a command line app that asked for an integer, and then printed a pyramid of # symbols that high and wide. E.G:

```bash
Height: 4

   #  #
  ##  ##
 ###  ###
####  ####

```
The concept comes from creating basic computer games like Mario, where he would have to jump over these obstacles.

The last problem was to create a command line app that would ask for how much change you need, then work out the least amount of coins to give you.


## Module reflection

I tried to approach this module in a way of translating what I already knew in other languages over to C. Most of the concepts are the same â€” loops, if/else , etc.  There are some key differences though. C is a strongly typed language and you need to declare the type of data you will be using for every step. You are not able to just create a variable, it has to be explicitly declared as a string, or an Int, or a Char.

C does not hoist like JavaScript does. If you want to use the functions before they are written you must declare the prototype at the top of the file. You can then use them before they are actually written in the file.

Each file has to be compiled down to a file the computer actually executes.

A lot of the files utilise functions written by the Harvard team, and you need to remember to include these files at the top of the program to use them.
