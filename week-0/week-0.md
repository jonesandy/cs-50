# Week 0

This week was all about basic programming ideas. Served as more of an introduction to the concepts of programming. 

## Problem set 0

This was a simple game in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). It was designed to understand the basic principles of programming.

## Module reflection

This module was very much a basic introduction to what is coming up. Basic understanding of how computers work and the most important fact that everything breaks down to binary. There is either electrical current or there isn't. Everything we write ends up as machine binary.

Interesting to think that things like a charactor are 8 bits. And something like the letter A is represented by the number 65 in ASCII.  Which in binary is ```01000001```
